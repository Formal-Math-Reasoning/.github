# Formal Math Reasoning

[![Website](https://img.shields.io/badge/Website-Live-brightgreen)](https://formal-math-reasoning.github.io)

We research the intersection of **Large Language Models** and **Formal Verification**. Our goal is to bridge natural language mathematics and machine-verifiable proofs through autoformalisation.

| **DRIFT** | Decomposing informal mathematical statements into smaller, more tractable sub-components improves autoformalisation performance, especially on out-of-distribution benchmarks. | ICLR 2026 | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10815) · [Code](#) |
| **TopoAlign** | TopoAlign unlocks widely available code repositories as training resources for Math LLMs by structurally aligning code to formal mathematical statements. | Preprint | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11944) · [Code](#) |
| **Conjecturing** | Conjecturing is an overlooked step in formal mathematical reasoning with LLMs and introduce ConjectureBench to evaluate conjecture generation across three settings: as a standalone task, during autoformalisation, and during proving. | Preprint | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11986) · [Code](#) |
